# minecraft_rust

Hello, this is my personal project in opengl, recreating main concepts of minecraft in rust. 
Its hard work. Started on 22-03-2021. Main inspiration was the video how a guy made minecraft 
from strach in c using opengl. Looked hard, so i decided to one up and do it in rust, i honestly 
did not know what i was getting myself into. It took 3 weeks to render a cube.
